### **Project Title: Task Management and Notification System**

#### **Problem Statement:**
Build a Task Management and Notification System that enables users to create, assign, and manage tasks efficiently. The system should support real-time notifications for task updates and reminders, utilize background processing for sending notifications and handling time-consuming tasks, and be deployable using Docker for consistent and reproducible environments.

#### **Project Requirements:**

1. **User Management:**
   - User registration and authentication (using Django's built-in user model or a custom user model).
   - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).

2. **Task Management:**
   - CRUD operations for tasks.
   - Assign tasks to users.
   - Set deadlines and priorities for tasks.
   - Track task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).

3. **Real-Time Notifications:**
   - Send real-time notifications to users about task assignments and updates.
   - Use WebSockets (e.g., Django Channels) to push notifications in real-time.

4. **Background Processing:**
   - Use Celery for background tasks such as sending email notifications, generating reports, and handling periodic reminders.
   - Schedule recurring tasks (e.g., daily summaries, deadline reminders).

5. **RESTful API:**
   - Expose APIs for all core functionalities (task creation, assignment, status updates).
   - Secure APIs using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).

6. **Docker Deployment:**
   - Create Dockerfiles for different services (Django app, Celery worker, Celery beat, Redis, Postgres).
   - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-container applications.

#### **Technical Stack:**
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST framework, Django Channels
- **Task Queue:** Celery
- **Message Broker:** Redis
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose

#### **High-Level Implementation Plan:**

1. **Setup Django Project:**
   - Create a new Django project and configure PostgreSQL as the database.
   - Setup user authentication and role-based access control.

2. **Develop Task Management Module:**
   - Define Task model with necessary fields (title, description, assignee, status, priority, deadline).
   - Implement CRUD operations for tasks.
   - Create views and templates for task management (if creating a web interface).

3. **Implement RESTful APIs:**
   - Use Django REST framework to create serializers and viewsets for tasks.
   - Implement authentication and authorization for the APIs.

4. **Integrate Real-Time Notifications:**
   - Setup Django Channels for WebSockets.
   - Create a notification model and logic to send notifications on task updates.
   - Implement the front-end to display real-time notifications (optional).

5. **Setup Celery for Background Tasks:**
   - Configure Celery with Django and Redis.
   - Create Celery tasks for sending email notifications and periodic reminders.
   - Schedule periodic tasks using Celery beat.

6. **Containerize the Application:**
   - Write Dockerfiles for the Django app, Celery worker, and Celery beat.
   - Setup Docker Compose to manage multi-container application (Django, Redis, PostgreSQL).

7. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests for the APIs and background tasks.
   - Test the Docker setup locally.
   - Deploy the application using Docker Compose in a staging/production environment.

#### **Bonus Features:**
- Implement a front-end using React or Vue.js to consume the RESTful APIs.
- Add support for OAuth2 authentication (e.g., Google, GitHub).
- Implement advanced task filtering and searching capabilities.
